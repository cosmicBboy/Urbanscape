# Urbanscape
***

Welcome to the Urbanscape Agent-Based Model. 

I'm interested in looking at how the food environment shapes the distribution of nutrition-link morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The main research question: "How does the income and employment composition of urban neighborhoods interact with the local food environment?"

This is a time-discrete model that simulates economic decisions made by `Food Providers`, which are the agents that act within the `Urbanscape`. 

I have implemented two subclasses of `Food Providers`: `Fastfood Restaurants` and `Grocery Stores`.
